# Data Structures in C#

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures built from scratch using C#.

The goal of this project is to deeply understand how data structures work internally without using built-in collections like List, Queue, or Stack.

## Implemented Data Structures

- Static Array
- Dynamic Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Trees (Coming Soon)
- Graphs (Coming Soon)

## Algorithms

- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms

## Features

✔ Implemented from scratch  
✔ Clean and readable code  
✔ Educational purpose  
✔ Object-Oriented Design  
✔ Written in C#

## Why This Project?

This project is created to strengthen problem-solving skills and understand the internal behavior of data structures, which is essential for software engineering interviews and real-world applications.

## Technologies

- C#
- .NET
